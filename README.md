# Final Test for Java Lambda, Stream and File IO

In this final test I build a simple application for storing vocabulary and the translation between English and Bahasa Indonesia. It has 5 main menu:

```
- View all vocabulary
- Search vocabulary by keyword
- View vocabulary by limit items
- Add vocabulary
- Exit
```

## How to execute:

1. Please make sure you already install maven on you computer
2. Change to root directory of the project
3. Run `mvn package` or `mvn test` to build the project and run unit testing
4. Run `mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.exercise.MainClass"` to run the project.
